Great question!

### 🆚 Data Classes vs Named Tuples in Python

Both **`namedtuple`** and **`@dataclass`** are used to create simple classes that hold data, but **`dataclass` provides more flexibility and features**. Here's a clear comparison:

---

### ✅ 1. **Mutability**

* `namedtuple` is **immutable** (you can't change values after creation).
* `dataclass` is **mutable** by default (you can change values).

---

### ✅ 2. **Default Values & Type Hints**

* `dataclass` supports **default values**, **default factories**, and **type hints**.
* `namedtuple` has limited support for defaults (requires `_replace()`).

---

### ✅ 3. **Additional Methods**

* `dataclass` supports **methods like `__post_init__()`**, comparisons, sorting, etc., and is easy to extend.
* `namedtuple` is less flexible for method definitions.

---

### ✅ 4. **Custom Behavior**

* `dataclass` allows overriding of methods like `__eq__`, `__lt__`, etc.
* `namedtuple` is fixed after creation.

## 🧪 Example: `namedtuple` vs `dataclass`

### 🔸 Using `namedtuple`

```python
from collections import namedtuple

Person = namedtuple("Person", ["name", "age"])
p1 = Person("Alice", 25)

print(p1.name)     # OK
# p1.age = 30      ❌ Error: can't assign to field
```

---

### 🔹 Using `dataclass`

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int = 0  # Default value allowed

p2 = Person("Bob", 30)
print(p2.name)     # Bob
p2.age = 35        # ✅ OK (mutable)
print(p2.age)      # 35
```

### ✅ Summary Table

| Feature               | `namedtuple`   | `dataclass`            |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Mutability            | Immutable      | Mutable                |
| Default Values        | Hard to define | Easy with `=`          |
| Type Annotations      | Optional       | Required (recommended) |
| Extra Methods         | Limited        | Easy to define         |
| Custom Init/Post Init | Not available  | Supported              |

---

### ✔️ Conclusion

Use **`dataclasses`** when:

* You need **mutability**.
* You want **default values**, **type safety**, and **custom logic**.
* You're building more complex models.

Use **`namedtuple`** for:

* **Lightweight, immutable** records with few fields.
