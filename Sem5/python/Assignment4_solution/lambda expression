In a **lambda function**, the `expression` can be any valid Python expression that evaluates to a value. Unlike regular functions, lambda functions are limited to a single expression, which is automatically returned. Here's a breakdown of what can go into the `expression`:

---

### **1. Arithmetic Operations**
You can use basic arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(5, 3))  # Output: 8
```

---

### **2. Conditional Expressions**
You can include conditional logic using a **ternary operator**.

```python
max_val = lambda x, y: x if x > y else y
print(max_val(10, 20))  # Output: 20
```

---

### **3. String Operations**
String concatenation, slicing, or formatting can be included in the expression.

```python
concat = lambda s1, s2: s1 + " " + s2
print(concat("Hello", "World"))  # Output: "Hello World"
```

```python
length = lambda s: len(s)
print(length("Python"))  # Output: 6
```

---

### **4. List and Tuple Operations**
You can perform indexing, slicing, and other list operations.

```python
get_second = lambda lst: lst[1]
print(get_second([10, 20, 30]))  # Output: 20
```

```python
sum_first_two = lambda lst: lst[0] + lst[1]
print(sum_first_two([5, 10, 15]))  # Output: 15
```

---

### **5. Dictionary Operations**
You can access or manipulate dictionary keys and values.

```python
get_value = lambda d, key: d.get(key, "Key not found")
print(get_value({"a": 1, "b": 2}, "a"))  # Output: 1
```

---

### **6. Boolean Expressions**
You can use logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not`.

```python
is_even = lambda x: x % 2 == 0
print(is_even(4))  # Output: True
```

---

### **7. Function Composition**
You can call other functions within the lambda expression.

```python
square = lambda x: x ** 2
cube = lambda x: square(x) * x
print(cube(3))  # Output: 27
```

---

### **8. Map or Filter Logic**
Lambda functions are often used with `map()` and `filter()`.

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squared = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, nums))
print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

---

### **9. Complex Expressions**
You can combine multiple operations, including calling functions or performing calculations.

```python
complex_op = lambda x, y: (x + y) ** 2 - x * y
print(complex_op(3, 2))  # Output: 21
```

---

### **10. Type Casting**
You can include type conversion operations in the expression.

```python
to_int = lambda x: int(x)
print(to_int("123"))  # Output: 123
```

---

### Things to Remember:
1. **Single Expression**: A lambda can only contain one expression, though it can be a complex one.
2. **No Statements**: Statements like `if`, `for`, or `while` cannot be used directly; only expressions are allowed.
3. **Anonymous**: Lambda functions don't have a name unless explicitly assigned to a variable.

---

### Examples Combining Multiple Features:
```python
# A lambda to find the square of a number if it's even, else return -1
process_number = lambda x: x ** 2 if x % 2 == 0 else -1
print(process_number(4))  # Output: 16
print(process_number(5))  # Output: -1
```
